My project will be analysing confirmed planets discovered by the Kepler telescope. 
I analysed these planets based on there orbit and temperature.
I create a bar graph to display 100 planets from a datasets orbit length in days and the planets temperature in kelvin.
I also created a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between a planets orbit length and the planets temperature.
